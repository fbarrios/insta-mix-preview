# insta-mix-preview

This script receives as parameters the file paths of the mix cover (1600x1600
png file), the mix file (only tested with wav), and a list of the timestamps from
where 10s samples will be extracted.

It will generate up to 5 videos playing the samples in the background and a
visualization of the music with stacked bars. Videos will be in 1080x1080 which is
Instagram's suggested resolution (source: https://help.instagram.com/1631821640426723).

Random squares of the album cover passed will be used as a background. Output is in
the output directory.
